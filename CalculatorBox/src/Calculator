In this tutorial, we will build a calculator from scratch using the BoxLayout
 to align the components of the calculator correctly.
 This calculator will consist of the GUI and the logic part,
 which performs computations.
 We will also learn how real-life calculators work under the hood
 by incorporating functionalities like addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, etc.
